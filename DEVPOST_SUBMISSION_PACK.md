## Devpost submission pack (Gemini 3 Hackathon)

### Project name
**Compass — AI Coaching That Turns Insight Into Action**

### One-liner
An AI coaching app that helps you reflect, commit to next steps, and track progress—powered by **Gemini 3** for real-time coaching + structured memory.

## 200-word Gemini integration blurb (copy/paste)
Compass is a personal coaching companion built around a simple loop: reflect → choose a next step → stay accountable → see progress. We use the Gemini API as the core intelligence layer, with **Gemini 3** as the default model for real-time coaching responses. Each coaching turn is generated by Gemini from a structured prompt pipeline: coach persona + user context + long-term memory + session-type instructions (Quick Check-in, Deep Dive, Reflection, etc.) + recent conversation window. 

Compass also uses Gemini to produce structured coaching artifacts from the conversation (session summaries, commitments, and user memories). These artifacts are stored in Supabase Postgres and later injected back into the coaching prompt so the coach can follow up naturally on prior goals and commitments. For voice, users can record a note; the backend transcribes audio and feeds the transcript into the same coaching pipeline. 

To keep trust high, Compass includes a **Memory Vault** where users can review, edit, disable, or delete what the app remembers. This combination—Gemini 3 coaching + structured memory + user-controlled privacy—creates a coaching experience that feels continuous, actionable, and personal.

## Demo script (3 minutes)
1. **0:00–0:20 — Problem**
   - “Most chatbots feel like conversation, not coaching. Coaching needs outcomes and continuity.”

2. **0:20–0:50 — Start a session**
   - Home → “Start a coaching session”
   - Show session type selector (e.g., Reflection vs Deep Dive)

3. **0:50–1:40 — Gemini 3 turn**
   - Send a user message (stress/decision example)
   - Point out the coach’s tone + questions (session type behavior)

4. **1:40–2:20 — Action + accountability**
   - Show Commitments on Home
   - Add/edit commitment: “what”, “why it matters”, “due date”, “reminder”
   - Snooze/reschedule and mark done

5. **2:20–2:45 — Memory Vault (trust)**
   - Settings → Memory Vault
   - Show a memory item, disable it, edit it, delete it

6. **2:45–3:00 — Progress**
   - Journey/Growth Dashboard: sessions, streak, insights timeline
   - Close: “Gemini 3 is central: coaching + structured artifacts + continuity.”
